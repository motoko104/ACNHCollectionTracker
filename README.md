# ACNHCollectionTracker

A simple React Native application to track your progress of the items you have collected within Animal Crossing: New Horizon.

### `Reason for Development`

While playing the newest Animal Crossing game, New Horizon, I would instinctively grab one of my many empty notebooks and write down the items that are available for a particular event set and cross them off as I got each one. Although there has only been two events that have happened after its release at the end of March 2020, I still found it a little more work than necessary to look up what items were in the set for the event, how to get them, and to write them down and mark them off the list as I got them. I wanted an application that will show me what items are in the set, how I can get the items, and be able to mark the items as complete so that I could keep track of what I still needed to get in the game before the event time was over.

This will be where most up to date images of my app will be posted as I work through this application.

### `Contributors`

Building this app was solely done on my own, Amanda Padilla, but the idea was inspired by my love for the Animal Crossing game series which is Liscensed by Nintendo.
